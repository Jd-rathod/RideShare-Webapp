RideShare webapp allows you to

  2. Daily pool in a Group
  3. Get a Long Distance pool ride

To use all of these services you need to have an account as normal user. If you are willing to give ride to others than you must have registered as driver. You have to add information about your self, vehicles you use, current vehicle (if you have added more than 1 vehicle), and info about start location and destination as per different types of pool you offer.

If you need an instant ride you can see available rides and can join one of them. If you have group of collegues from nearby area then you can make a group and daily use pool services. To join a group you can see available groups as per your route and join one of them.

To get an idea how it is actually working you can explore the **Webapp_images** folder and see some of the screenshots.
